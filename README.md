# S3 Exploit

This is my recreating of the S3 bootscript exploit which allows to overwrite UEFI on vulnerable systems. I created this as an excerise to learn subject like UEFI exploitiation and Linux kernel hacking. The project generates an bootable usb stick with a small Linux instance with a custom kernel module. When booted the exploit automatically unlocks BIOS and allows for overwriting the firmaware with any provided image. I used it to install an SMM backdoor created in another repo insinde my old T430 thinkpad.
